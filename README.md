# Car-rental-with-Excel
Data analysis done for a car-rental company with MS Excel.
Data analysis for Lariat by Devang Trivedi		
	Based on 2018 dataset.	
		
Worksheets:		
		
Car_Dashboard:		
	This is the Excel model, that can be used to make data-informed decisions about car purchases.	
	Far left, there are five options to generate a report.	
		Car-Make lets you choose any, multiple or all car-makes from the entire fleet.
		Rest of the variables are Cost, Revenue, Rent-Days and Customers.
		Each of these have 5 options to choose from:
		A This is the worst option
		B is bad option
		C is an average option
		D is better option
		E is the best option
		
Car-Make Report:		
	This is the secondary or companion report to Car_Dashboard.	
	Here, you can also select Car-Make from the fleet.	
	You can quickly compare selected Car-Make with whole fleet.	
		
Accidents Reports:		
	This report is also based on Car-Make, which helps to decide on selling and buying cars.	
	It has three more variables to choose from:	
		Car-Model Year
		"On The Road" Category (options A-E)
		Accident numbers
	There are additional tables for more detailed information on far right:	
		First table shows details based on amount of accidents.
		Second one shows "Top 10" branches with car accident incidents.
		
There are total 7 strategies given and described with individual worksheet.		
The three most effective strategies then were combined based on 2018 data in separate worksheet.		
		
Strategy 1		
1 More Branches:		
	All branch locations were divided between five regions:	
		Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and West.
		Northeast and Midwest regions can be used to open 5 more branches each.
	Opening 10 more branches in these regions will expand business and bring in more customers.	
		
Strategy 2		
2 Airport Comparison:		
	22 branches near airports brought more business compared to branches away from airports.	
	Opening 10 more branches near airport will provide more business than other branches.	
		
Strategy 3		
3 Under 25 Customers:		
	We need to start accepting customers whose age is under 25.	
	Quite few competitors are renting vehicles with extra charges to under 25 customer group.	
	We can start this option to bring in more customers.	
	It is advisable to charge more fees and limit the choice of cars for under 25 group.	
		
Combined Strategies 1 2 3:		
	Above given strategies were combined and this worksheet shows calculations based on 2018 data.	
		
Some extra strategies		
		
4 Model Year Comparison:		
	This strategy compares all three car-model years 2016, 2017 and 2018 with cost and revenue.	
	Data shows clearly that the oldest car-model year 2016 brought less revenue compared to others.	
	Selling off cars older than 2 years can improve business and bring more customers.	
		
5 Net Profit:		
	In 2018, total 55 cars "earned" less than what it costed to the company.	
	Spending money and time to these cars will return absolutely nothing.	
	We should sell these cars and invest in other popular and in demand cars.	
		
6 Unpopular Cars:		
	These cars, customers did not use or used very less compared to other cars.	
	Report is based on Car-Maker (on far left).	
		it also has three more variables to choose from:
		Car-Model Year
		On The Road Category (based on Rent-Days) (options A-E).
		Rent-days per Customer
	On far right, couple of tables show information based on what user has chosen:	
		Cars that have total Rent-Days less than or equal to:
		Cars that have total Customers less than or equal to:
	Selecting 60 Rent-Days and 25 cars for these above given options, shows negative net revenue.	
	This selection found 110 cars, that customers did not use in 2018.	
		
7 Slow Months:		
	Report 1 and Report 2 show first ten months of total customers per branch with some options.	
	First table in third report clearly shows February as the common slowest month everywhere.	
	We can run promotional or special rates or last minute online sell to draw more customers.	
	Running these specials in February and March countrywide will attract more new customers too.	
		
Together:		
	All 7 scenarios to solve for revenue optimization are inside one worksheet for comparison.	
		
		
		
car_costs_details		
car_revenue_details		
branch_location_details		
	These worksheets contain data from 2018 dataset with additional columns added for analysis.	
		
car_id_mapping		
car_costs		
car_revenue		
branch_location		
	These are original 2018 dataset provided by Lariat for data analysis.
